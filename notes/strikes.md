# Strikes


# Edges
- **True Edge**: The edge facing outward from your sword arm.
- **False Edge**: The edge facing inward toward your sword arm.

# Principal Cuts
- **Forehand Cut (Mandritto)**: Diagonal cut right-to-left across opponent.
- **Backhand Cut (Roverso)**: Diagonal cut left-to-right across opponent.
- **Vertical Downward Cut (Fendente)**: Straight cut down from above, aimed at head.
- **False Edge Cut (Falso)**: Cut made with back edge, rising or descending.
- **Rising Cuts/Upward cuts**: 
    - true edge = Rising Forehand/Backhand
    - false edge = Rising Falso.
- Always accompany a cut with a turn of the body whether half or full cuts

# Turns of the hand
- **Half turn** : 
  - Wrist turn, probably supination/pronation.
  - Also a change of guards that only moves the sword
- **Full turn** : 
  - Full rotation of the hand, changing the edge used.
  - Also a change of guards that moves the sword and the body.

# Thrusts
- **Underhand Thrust (Stoccata/Trivillata)**: Upward thrust from below.
- **Overhand Thrust (Imbroccata)**: Descending thrust from above, like lightning.
- **Reverse Overhand Thrust**: Overhand thrust from the backhand side.
- **Straight Thrust (Punta Ferma)**: Direct thrust forward, no wrist turn.

# Special Cuts
- **Circular Cut (Tramazzone)**: Quick wrist-driven circle cut, often ending downward (full turn).
- **Moulinet (Molinello)**: Rotating cut, quick return to guard (full turn).
- **Rising Cut (Montante)**: From below, lifting false edge into high guard.

# Cut Variations
- **Half Cut**: Short cut that stops early, point still threatening enemy. These are perfectly valid to wound and might be preferred overall. To be used in close game and must be done quickly.
- **Full Cut (Perfect Cut)**: Complete descending cut from high guard to low guard.
- **Redoubled Cut**: Repeated strike, often after a feint or failed blow.
- **Feints**: False attacks to draw a reaction before striking.

# Perfect vs Imperfect Attacks
- **Perfect Attack**: Hits opponent while keeping yourself safe.
- **Imperfect Attack**: Lands a hit but leaves you exposed.
- **Key Principle**: Execution quality (speed, grace, precision) determines perfection.
