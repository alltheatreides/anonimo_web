# General Teachings
## Foundations of Mastery
- Expertise requires: Attention to detail → Perseverance → Toil → Patience → Love of the art → Understanding → Prudence → Knowledge → Judgment.
- Fear must be banished: the fearful cannot prevail.

## Mindset & Character
- Reject humility, niceties, laziness, or meekness in combat.
- Adopt fierceness, cruelty, mercilessness — appear like a lion, bear, or devil.
- Every motion should show the intent to wound.

## Core Virtues of the Art
- Four essentials: Courage, Cunning, Strength, Skill.
- Possessing these virtues ensures victory against any lacking opponent, and even when matched, superiority in one   virtue can decide the fight.
- Ornament of the art = intelligent skill guided by courage and prudence.

## The Supreme Sense
- Good eyesight surpasses all virtues: Like stars to the night, it illuminates the art. Without sight, no other virtue avails.

## On Honor & Conduct
- Honor is greater than life; dishonor is ruin.
- Hide wounds — showing pain gives courage to the enemy.
- Never turn your shoulders in combat: it dishonors you (Tuomas would be proud).
- Be quick, vigilant, and mindful of secrets of the art.

## Practice & Perseverance
- Constant training is required; laziness breeds defeat.
- Never despair after being struck: respond fiercely, remain constant.
- Learn guards, attacks in tempo, and ripostes diligently.

##  Styles of Play
- Gioco Largo (Wide Play): Wide stance, extended cuts, full flowing attacks, graceful but open. Avoid mezza spada (?? what is mezza spada). Beautiful and gallant to watch.
- Gioco Stretto (Close Play): Narrow stance, short steps, sword kept in presence, half-attacks. Requires cunning and maliciousness; ignorance here is dangerous.
- A good fencer must know both; use one style to counter the other. (not sure how that works)

## Tactical Counsel
- Watch the enemy’s weapon-hand, not his face.
- Use feints to open defended targets.
- Train with both hands; prepare for left-handers.
- Change guard and position constantly, like Proteus, to remain unreadable.
- Footwork must be martial, not dance-like: strong, controlled, tied to the sword.

## Training & Technique
- Practice with heavy weapons to build strength and refinement (Imma skip this one).
- Extend arms in training for control and tempo.
- Defending and riposting is more praiseworthy than striking first (Based priority convention ?).

## On Opponents
- The brute seeks utility, the gallant beauty; both exist.
- True judgment lies in balancing effectiveness with grace.
- Never reveal your intent to the enemy.
- Beware ignorance — even a lion’s heart cannot save a foolish fighter.

## False Edge Defenses
- False edge parries are strongest:
  - Deflect enemy’s sword powerfully.
  - Open immediate lines for riposte.
