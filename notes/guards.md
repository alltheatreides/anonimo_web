# Guards
## High Guards
- **Head Guard** (Guardia di testa): Arms extended forward at shoulder height; sword slightly lower than buckler (not specified but likely sword on the left side).
- **High Guard** (Guardia Alta): Sword raised overhead; buckler extended toward opponent’s face.
- **Unicorn Guard** (Guardia di Lioncorno): Sword angled down like a horn; point at opponent’s face; sword hand high. (similar to head guard, but probably a difference in the way the sword is held)
- **Face Guard** (Guardia di Faccia): Like Unicorn but sword lower, point straight at enemy face, hand covered by buckler. (So probably supinated hand ?)
- **Over-Arm Guard** (Guardia di Sopra Braccio): Sword held back over shoulder, point behind; buckler forward.
- **Entering Guard**: Sword point at face, but hands close to head; right foot lightly forward. (Pronated hand as if drawing the sword ?)

## Iron Gate Guards
- **High Iron Gate**: Sword extended low at side; point at face; right foot far forward. Left at an angle that the knee is bent.
- **Narrow Iron Gate**: Like High Iron Gate, but sword lower by knee; buckler high. Both legs bent (The differences seem to be only in leg positions ?)
- **Wide Iron Gate**: Like Narrow, but sword point angled down (not below the middle of the bent knees.

## Boar’s Gate Guards
- **High Boar’s Gate**: Left foot forward bent, right back extended; sword point at enemy face; buckler high at the head.
- **Narrow Boar’s Gate**: Like High Boar’s but sword lowered before left knee. (Hand supination ?)
- **Wide Boar’s Gate**: Like Narrow but sword point not threatening lying across the left knee.

## Long Tail Guards
- **High Long Tail**: Sword arm extended diagonally at side, point at opponent; buckler forward. Foot forward, somewhat bent.
- **Narrow Long Tail**: Same as before. Sword lowered by right knee, point forward.
- **Wide Long Tail**: Sword angled down toward ground.
- **Long Long Tail**: Sword turned back at the right knee, point backward (‘tail’).
