# The Art of the Single Sword

A fighter may do one of three main things against his enemy:
- Advance forward
- Retreat backward
- Stand firm in place

Each of these has three distinct ways to be done, for a total of nine ways — all of which can be done artfully or ignorantly.


## 1. Going Forward
- **Beastly Attack:** Charge forward, striking furiously without concern for defense.
- **Defensive Advance:** Move forward without striking, maintaining strong defense.
- **Advance with Attack:** Move forward while defending and striking at once.


## 2. Retreating Backward
- **Pure Retreat:** Withdraw without striking, defending yourself only.
- **Hand Attacks:** Retreat while continually striking at the opponent’s sword hand (yum).
- **Retreat & Counter:** Withdraw while defending and striking at the enemy. (I suppose it means counter-attacking actions with blade opposition.)


## 3. Standing Firm
- **Beastly Stand:** Stay rooted, striking rapidly without defense.
- **Defensive Stand:** Hold your ground without attacking, purely defending.
- **Countering Stand:** Defend strongly while also striking from your position.


## Circling Footwork
Beyond these, the feet may be used differently while the sword remains within the above framework:
- **Circle Left:** Move around the enemy to his left side.
- **Circle Right:** Circle to his right side, either sliding one foot after the other or stepping quickly.


## Perseverance
- Steadfast practice refines agility and skill.
- The more constant one’s perseverance, the brighter their art will shine.


## Wide Play (Gioco Largo)
- Wide, complete attacks (head to feet).
- Fought from wide guards with extended arms, open stance, graceful body turns, molinetti and tramazzoni.
- Pleasing to the eye, gallant, admired by spectators.
- **Key Rule:** Never allow yourself to be caught in mezza spada (half-sword ?). If this happens, you must know the gioco stretto.


## Narrow Play (Gioco Stretto)
- Fought from narrow (stretta) guards.
- Sword kept in presence, always threatening the enemy’s body or hand.
- Attacks are half-strikes, not full cuts.
- Feet close together, short steps.
- Requires cunning and skill; without this, it shows cowardice or ignorance.
- A shrewd fencer in narrow play can strike in countless ways, especially at half sword (??).
- **Key Rule:** Sword must not be offered to the enemy except to advantage.


# Conclusion
All nine modes of movement, circling, and both large and narrow play and can be practiced either artfully with cunning or ignorantly with brute instinct. True mastery lies in combining perseverance, skill, and judgment with these structures.
