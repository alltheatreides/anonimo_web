# MSS Ravenna M-345/346 translation by Stephen Fratus notes


# Steps

- **Half Step (Mezzo Passo / Medium Stance)**: Small step forward with lead foot, half distance. Used to adjust measure or renew attack/defense.
- **Full Step (Passo Intiero / Wide Stance)**: Long stride forward with rear foot passing ahead. Closes distance decisively.
- **Change of Feet (Cambiare di Piedi): Switch lead foot**: bring lead back near rear, then advance the other. Useful if front leg is threatened.
- **Gathering Step (L’uno piede spinga l’altro)**: Bring back foot near front, then move front forward again (or reverse). Balanced advance/retreat.
- **Reprise of the Feet (Ripresa di Piedi)**: Bring rear near front, then step forward again with lead. Can be done in all directions to reset balance contrary to the previous step.
- **Double Passing Step (Trapassare di Piedi)**: Two long passes in sequence, often angling to the opponent’s side.
Combines movement with attack/feint.
- **Traversing Step (Passare di Traverso)**: Step diagonally across to opponent’s side, off the direct line.
- **Triangle Step (Passare di Triangulo)**: Deeper diagonal than traverse, forming triangular path to opponent’s flank.
- **Raising the Foot (Levare di Piedi)**: Lift front leg to let a blow pass, then return it forward to counter. Can retreat it behind then replace forward.
- **Special Use: Para Piedi**: Hook instep behind opponent’s foot after stepping in to unbalance them.
- **Straightening the Bent Leg**: Straighten bent lead leg when attacked, without moving foot. Lets strike pass safely
while extending reach slightly.

# Remarks
- Pressing (stringere): Closing distance towards opponent to pressure them and have them react, usually done with a gathering step.
